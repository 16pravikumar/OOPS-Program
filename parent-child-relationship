/*Parent-Child Relation-Parent also call child method using override

can parent class can be call child class method after extends in java???- Answer below
Yes, it is possible for a parent class to call a child class method in Java, but only if the child class has overridden a method that is defined in the parent class.

When a child class extends a parent class, it inherits all the methods and variables of the parent class. If the child class overrides a method that is defined in the parent class,
 the child class implementation of that method will be called when the method is invoked on an instance of the child class.

However, if the parent class calls the method on an instance of the child class, the child class implementation of the method will be called. This is known as method overriding, 
and it allows child classes to provide their own implementation of methods that are defined in the parent class. 
Here is an example to demonstrate this concept:
*/
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;
class Animal{
	public void eat() {
		System.out.print("Animal can eat ");
	}

	public void bark() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("Dog is part of Animal");
	}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
	@Override
	public void bark() {
		System.out.println("Dog can bark");
	}
}
public class javap {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Dog obj=new Dog();
		obj.eat();
		obj.bark();
		Animal obj1=new Dog();
		obj1.eat();
		obj1.bark();
		Animal obj2=new Animal();
		obj2.eat();
		obj2.bark();
	}

}
/*Animal can eat Dog can bark
  Animal can eat Dog can bark
  Animal can eat Dog is part of Animal
 * 
 */
